            <p>In the previous post, I went over some basics of how Kubernetes networking works from a fundamental standpoint. The requirements are simple: every pod needs to have connectivity to every other pod. The only differentiation between the many options were how that was achieved. In this post, I’m going to...</p>

            <p>I have some problems with Kubernetes. It’s a fantastic tool that is revolutionizing the way we do things at $work. However, because of its code complexity, and the vast number of features, plugins, addons and options, the documentation isn’t getting the job done. The other issue is that too many...</p>

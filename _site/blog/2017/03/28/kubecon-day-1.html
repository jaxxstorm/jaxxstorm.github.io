<p>I was lucky enough to be able to attend <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/cloudnativecon-and-kubecon-europe">CloudNativeCon/Kubecon</a> in Berlin, Germany. This is my recap of the first half day of lightning talks, panels and project updates.</p>

<p><em>Note - this is not an exhaustive recap. The stuff here is mainly what caught my eye during the first evening. Things are definitely missing</em></p>

<h1 id="fluentd-update">Fluentd update</h1>

<p>First up, we had an update from <a href="https://twitter.com/edsiper">Eduardo Silva</a> from <a href="https://www.treasuredata.com/">TreasureData</a> about the fantastic <a href="http://www.fluentd.org/">FluentD</a> project. The main highlight I can remember is that Fluentd now supports Windows logging. Eduardo’s made a <a href="https://twitter.com/briggsl/status/846753046667448320">joke</a> about “Windows being a serious system” and got a great laugh. There was a brief discussion of how fluentd solves the logging pipeline problem, and it’s definitely something I’ll be investigating as we try and better ship logs in our Kubernetes implementation.</p>

<h1 id="opentracing-update">OpenTracing update</h1>

<p>Next, we had <a href="https://twitter.com/pritianka">Priyanka Sharma</a> on stage to talk about <a href="http://opentracing.io/">OpenTracing</a>. This is something I was aware of, but hadn’t fully investigated, and Priyanka made it much clearer by demoing a custom “donut order” application she’d written with OpenTracing built in. She did a demo of the app (as a side note, she also asked everyone in the conference room to open a website, which I thought was crazy given the traditional state of conference wifi, but it worked!) and then drilled down into performance problems using OpenTracing. It was a fantastic visualization of how OpenTracing can solve problems, and I got a lot of value out of it!</p>

<h1 id="linkerd-update">Linkerd update</h1>

<p>Next up was <a href="https://twitter.com/olix0r">Oliver Gould</a> with an update about <a href="https://linkerd.io/">Linkerd</a> and the big news here is that Linkerd <a href="https://github.com/linkerd/linkerd-tcp">now has TCP Support!</a>. This is a massive step forward, and judging by reaction to my <a href="https://twitter.com/briggsl/status/846757094359519234">tweet</a> the community agrees!</p>

<p>Additionally, something that caught me eye is that linkerd now supports <a href="https://twitter.com/briggsl/status/846756604477353986">kubernetes ingress</a> in its config. I found a <a href="https://blog.buoyant.io/2016/11/18/a-service-mesh-for-kubernetes-part-v-dogfood-environments-ingress-and-edge-routing/">great blog post about this</a> on the bouyant blog, and this has me really excited.</p>

<h1 id="coredns-update">CoreDNS update</h1>

<p>The next thing I really paid attention to was the <a href="https://coredns.io/">CoreDNS</a> update by <a href="https://twitter.com/miekg">Miek Gieben</a> and this really stuck in my mind because I’ve really had some trouble and concerns around the kube-dns/skyDNS implementation currently being used in Kube. For some reason, a go shim coupled with dnsmasq and a sidecar container just doesn’t feel like the right way to do something that’s a critical component of the kubernetes stack.</p>

<p>With that in mind, Miek provided an update on CoreDNS, what it can do and why it’s “better” than kube-dns. <a href="https://twitter.com/briggsl/status/846759289104613377">This slide</a> stood out to me, and after reading some of the <a href="https://github.com/coredns/coredns/tree/master/middleware">available middleware plugins</a> I’m looking to replace kube-dns with CoreDNS as soon as I can!</p>

<h1 id="panel">Panel</h1>

<p>The panel was a real disappointment for me. It consisted of 3 senior/executive level employees of TicketMaster, Amadeus and Haufe-Lexware discussiong their transition to Kubernetes. I would have loved to have my bosses, and <em>their</em> bosses watch this panel, because there was some good conversation around how to transition organisations to new ways of thinking, but it was nothing I hadn’t already heard. I would have loved to have had maybe 5/10 operators on stage talking war stories of Kubernetes in production, with a little less “media training” feel to it. I understand there’s a wide range of attendees at this conference though, and I’m sure more people got value out of it than I did.</p>

<p>As a side note, I was very disappointed at the lack of diversity in the panel. I’m sure we could have found someone from a more diverse background/gender to be involved in the discussions.</p>

<h1 id="helm-with-appcontroller">Helm with AppController</h1>

<p>There was a nice short talk about the capabilities of the <a href="https://github.com/Mirantis/k8s-AppController">Mirantis Appcontroller</a> and this seems like a really interesting project. Essentially, this brings orchestration to your kubernetes cluster, and allows staged deployments (ie, don’t deploy the web app until your database is initialized) - I can see this getting heavy usage once it’s in Beta/ready to test, but as it stands it seems fairly new.</p>

<h1 id="bgp-routing-in-kubernetes">BGP Routing in Kubernetes</h1>

<p>This talk confused me, because it basically described what <a href="http://projectcalico.org/">Calico</a> already does, unless I’m missing something? Would love someone to fill in the gaps here.</p>

<h1 id="fluentd-logging-pipelines">Fluentd Logging Pipelines</h1>

<p>The last talk I really tuned in on was one that really stuck with me. <a href="https://twitter.com/krallistic">Jakob Karalus</a> talked about how he’d built a flexible logging service inside Kubernetes, using annotations and fluentd. <a href="https://twitter.com/briggsl/status/846782137328160770">This tweet</a> should give you an idea of how it works. This is a really interesting solution to a problem that is definitely on my mind at the moment - with Docker you can simple set <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/logging/overview/">the logging driver per container</a> but this is currently not possible in kubernetes (see <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/15478">this</a> issue for more details. Jakob’s solution provides an interesting mechanism for developers to be able to decide where they want their logs to go, and I think flexibility is always key. Check out <a href="https://github.com/krallistic/kubernetes-fluentd">his github repo</a> to see how it works.</p>

<h1 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h1>

<p>I’m hoping to write one of these for each day, but the amount of content may make that difficult! Let me know if you think I missed anything important!</p>
